# Inclusive Design Principles

A set of principles for designing inclusive web interfaces. The objectives of the principles are to provide design and user research teams with a set of inclusive design prompts that go beyond WCAG and help foster more inclusive, rather than just accessible, designs.

## The principles

TODO (set of agreed principles)

## Contributing

To contribute a principle, create an issue named after that principle (e.g. "Adaptable") and describe the principle, using supporting material, such as examples, where appropriate. This can be included in the **Web interfaces should be...** section above when consensus deems the principle complete.

## Translations

If you are providing a translation of the Inclusive Design Principles, please translate all text in the page, including text in attributes such as `alt` and `aria-label`.

In addition, please add translations for "expand all" and "collapse all" to the `translations` object in /js/scripts.js. For example, for the French translation:

```
fr: {
  EXPAND: "ouvrir tout",
  COLLAPSE: "fermer tout"
}
```

Language names must be in the language being linked to, for example the text for the link to the Japanese translation is "日本語" on all pages.

When you have made an update or added a new language variation, please issue a pull request and after review we will merge it in to the site.
