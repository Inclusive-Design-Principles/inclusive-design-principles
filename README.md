# Inclusive Design Principles

A set of principles for designing inclusive web interfaces. The objectives of the principles are to provide design and user research teams with a set of inclusive design prompts that go beyond WCAG and help foster more inclusive, rather than just accessible, designs.

The target audience are:
* TPG Tech for use when carrying out client work such as design reviews, consulting, competitive analysis, usability testing, user reseach, development work and audits.
* TPG Tech for reference in the TPG Pattern Library and Knowledge Base.
* Clients as part of the deliverables for seervices. They might be included in the design review template for example but could also be a Bonus Deliverables (https://www.dropbox.com/work/Internal/Bonus%20deliverables) when deliverable audits or other services. 
* Publication of the TPG blog.

## The principles

TODO (set of agreed principles)

## Contributing

To contribute a principle, create an issue named after that principle (e.g. "Adaptable") and describe the principle, using supporting material, such as examples, where appropriate. This can be included in the **Web interfaces should be...** section above when consensus deems the principle complete.
