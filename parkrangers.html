          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Whether out of circumstance, choice, or context people are diverse. As people use different approaches and tools to read and operate interfaces, what the interface offers each user should be comparable in both value and quality.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Editorial for alternatives:</strong> Having a basic alternative, whether it's alt text, a transcript, audio description, or sign language, makes the content accessible but to be equivalent it needs to capture the essence of the original.</li>
            <li><strong>Ergonomic features:</strong> Providing synchronized closed captions makes your video accessible. But making them customizable, color coded, and repositionable provides a more comparable experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Notifications that appear in an interface are visually obvious but require proactive discovery by screen reader users. A comparable experience for blind users, can be achieved by using a live region. The notification then requires no explicit action on the part of the user.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Your audience will include first time users, established users, users at work, users at home, users on the move, and users under pressure. All of these circumstances can have an impact. For those who already find interaction challenging, such as those with disabilities, this impact may make usage particularly difficult. Make provisions to lesson the impact of circumstantial conditions.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Colour contrast:</strong> When using an interface outdoors, good contrast lessens the impact of bright sunshine.</li>
            <li><strong>Context sensitive help:</strong> Users may need help when they first encounter a complex form or interaction. This help may become redundant, even distracting, as a user becomes more familiar with the form or interaction. Context sensitive help provides the user with choice as to when they access help and better control over the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Captions on the go:</strong> You're aware that the video content you are providing will be consumed on mobile devices, which means in public spaces. For smaller viewports, sound is switched off and captions activated by default. Users can consume the content without being antisocial.</li>

          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Familiar interfaces borrow from well-established patterns. These should be used consistently within the interface to reinforce their meaning and purpose. This should be applied to functionality, behavior, editorial, and presentation. You should say the same things in the same way and users should be able to do the same things in the same way.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Consistent design patterns:</strong> Use consistent web and platform design patterns to help build familiarity and understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent editorial:</strong> Use consistent editorial across platforms including editorial that is relied on by screen reader users such as text alternatives, headings, labels for buttons and so on.</li>

          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Do not suppress or disable the ability to change standard browser and platform settings such as orientation, font size, zoom, and contrast. In addition, avoid content changes that have not been initiated by the user unless there is a way to control it.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Scrolling control:</strong> 'Infinite scrolling' can be problematic, especially for users navigating by keyboard because they can't get past the stream of refreshing content. Give the option to turn off this feature and replace it with a 'load more' button.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it stop:</strong> Some users find animations cause nausea, and others find them plain distracting. Where they play automatically, they should at least be easy to stop, by providing prominent playback controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow zoom:</strong> There are many reasons why a user may want to operate the pinch-to-zoom gesture on their touch device. Make sure it is not suppressed, and that the content does not get obscured when it is put to use.</li>

          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Interfaces can be difficult to understand when core features are not clearly exposed and prioritised. A site or application may provide lots of information and functionality, but people should be able to focus on one thing at a time. Identify the core purpose of the interface, and then the content and features needed to fulfill that purpose.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Keep task focused:</strong> Progressively reveal features and content when needed, not all in one go.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritising tasks:</strong> An email application is principally for writing and reading email. The "compose" button is, therefore, present on all screens, and early in the focus order. The inbox is prioritised over other lists of email, such as "sent" and "spam" messages. Less used features such as tagging or organizing email into folders appear later in the focus order, as they will generally only be used when the primary task of reading the email is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritising content:</strong> The primary content on a news article page is the story, therefore it should come before other content, both visually and in the source order. Related content, such as similar articles, should follow it, and unrelated content after that.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritising editorial:</strong> Editorial for links, headings and buttons should put the primary text first. This applies to both visible and hidden text. This makes the text easy to scan both visually and audibly for screen reader users.</li>

          <h4>Full description</h4>
          <p>Features should add value to the user experience by providing efficient and diverse ways to find and interact with content. Consider device features such as voice, geolocation, camera and vibration API's, and how integration with connected devices or a second screen could provide choice.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <ul class="examples">
            <li><strong>Integration with connected devices or second screen:</strong> For example using voice interfaces to control multimedia, search for content, output from music or TV adds value for people who struggle to use other interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with platform APIs:</strong> For example using the vibration API to make notifications for usable by deaf and hard of hearing people, or the geolocation API to make it easier for people to use location based services.</li>
            <li><strong>Make task completion easier:</strong> Add a 'Show password' button to input fields so users can verify they have correctly inputted text, or add touch identification for password protected areas.</li>
