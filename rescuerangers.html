      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Inclusive design is the practice of making products and interfaces that can be used and enjoyed by different people in different situations. When employing inclusive interface design, you provide better experiences for readers, customers, players and collaborators. The purpose of this document is to set out the core principles of inclusive interface design.</p>
      <p>The inclusive design approach to accessibility is intersectional. It appreciates that the abilities and disabilities of any one person are not necessarily permanent or stable. They can be multiple, intermittent, and dependent on changing circumstances. It addresses the relationships between social, environmental, physical, and technological conditions.</p>
      <p>Inclusive design recognizes that people differ in their adaptations to any of these conditions. An inclusive interface therefore has to be flexible, and sometimes multifaceted. It is through flexibility that robustness is achieved. A robust interface is less likely to fail anyone, whoever they are.</p>

      <p><em>Technologies, workflows, and processes should be put in service of people, including end-users and contributors.</em></p>

        <p>The W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">priority of constituencies</a> implores you to prioritize the needs of users over your comfort as a developer. In pursuit of the maintainability and extensibility of your interface you should never sacrifice accessibility or usability. The tools you employ should subscribe to the same philosophy.</p>
      </div>
      <h4><button data-expands="people-first-egs" aria-expanded="false"><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></i> Examples</button></h4>
      <div id="people-first-egs" style="display: none">
        <ul class="examples">
          <li><strong>Choice of CMS:</strong> In choosing a Content Management System, you only shortlist systems which support and encourage accessible front-end output, and incorporate accessible content management tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal communications:</strong> You ensure that communications do not marginalize anyone involved on your project and in your team. Supplement inaccessible media such as data visualizations with descriptions for those that can't see or easily understand them.</li>
          <li><strong>Your pattern library:</strong> You do not allow any components that do not meet accessibility standards to be included in your pattern library. Proposed components are vetted using accessibility testing, preferably with user testers as well as automated tools.</li>

      <p><em>The purpose and intended outcomes of a feature should be defined as the basis for following other design principles, particularly <a href="#aim-for-equivalence">equivalence</a>.</em></p>

      <div id="define-purpose-desc" class="smaller" style="display: none">
        <p>Inclusive design is not concerned with ornamentation. Every design decision should be informed by the needs and goals of users, as established by research and consensus. Features without a user-driven mandate should not be included at all, and those that are should address users' needs as simply and directly as possible.</p>

      <div id="define-purpose-egs" style="display: none">
        <ul class="examples">
          <li><strong>The author image:</strong> An image of an author might have the purpose of identification or for use in promotional material. Depending on the surrounding content the image could be considered decorative or content. If merely decorative, it has nothing of value to offer non-visually and can be hidden to assistive technologies.</li>

      <div id="equivalence-desc" class="smaller" style="display: none">
        <p>Interfaces are provided for different purposes, such as entertainment, information, and for completing tasks. Although users take different approaches and use different tools to read and operate interfaces, what the interface offers each user should be comparable in terms of both quantity and quality. In pursuit of this end, some editorial creativity may be required to translate between mediums — such as audio versus visual.</p>
      </div>
      <h4><button data-expands="equivalence-egs" aria-expanded="false"><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></i> Examples</button></h4>
      <div id="equivalence-egs" style="display: none">
        <ul class="examples">
          <li><strong>Judicious audio description:</strong> For an audio description of a televised drama, you only include information pertinent to the narrative. Describing everything in frame would be as distracting non-visually as examining it all visually.</li>
          <li><strong>The visual pun:</strong> An image serves as a visual pun, with the hope of amusing your audience. Describing it literally makes it unfunny so an equivalent joke is provided as the image's alternative text.</li>

        <p>Your audience will include first time users, established users, hurried users, users at work, users at home. All of these circumstances can have an impact.

          <li><strong>Keyboard shortcut tip:</strong> A first-time user will not be aware of the custom keyboard shortcuts you have implemented for them. You provide this information as a "tip" which can be dismissed permanently, reducing clutter on subsequent visits.</li>
          <li><strong>Captions on the go:</strong> You're aware that the video content you are providing will be consumed on mobile devices, which means in public spaces.

        <p>Usable interfaces are founded on conventions; interface patterns which appear and work in ways the user has experienced before, both within and without your application. Take conventions and make them your own, rather than breaking with conventions entirely.</p>

        <ul class="examples">
          <li><strong>The navigation bar:</strong> Conventionally, site navigation takes the form of a horizontal list of links placed at the top of the web page. You adopt this convention, enhancing it with a creatively attractive "current page" indicator.</li>
          <li><strong>Label configuration:</strong> You resist the temptation to appear innovative by placing your input labels below and to the right of your inputs. There's too much danger that they will be missed or associated with the wrong input.</li>

In each case, the same product information is provided in the same order, using the same markup and the same visual orientation.</li>
          <li><strong>Familiar language:</strong> Different versions of your application for different platforms use the same language, especially for controls, headings and field labels.</li>

          <li><strong>Stop things moving:</strong> You provide animated illustrations by default. For those that find the animations distracting or experience vestibular issues, provide a setting to turn the animations off — preferably in such a way that the choice is remembered between sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Allow pinch zoom:</strong> There are many reasons why a user may want to operate the "pinch zoom" gesture on their touch device. Make sure it is not suppressed, and that the content does not get obscured when it is put to use.</li>

        <p>There is no one "right" way to do anything.

        <ul class="examples">
          <li><strong>Swipe-to-delete alternative:</strong> You provide a "swipe to delete" action/gesture for items available in a list configuration. Not confident that all users will be aware of this implementation or able to use it effectively, you also provide a supplementary "delete" button at each item's permalink.</li>
          <li><strong>Grids versus lists:</strong> Aware that some users will find scanning a single-file list of items more comfortable than a four coulmn grid, you offer the ability to switch between the two display modes.</li>
          <li><strong>Data tables for all:</strong> You must provide a data table as an alternative for a complex visualisation to blind users. Instead of only providing it non-visually, you make it available to all. This way, anyone struggling with the complexity of the data has two ways of viewing it.</li>

        <p>Interfaces may provide lots of information and functionality simultaneously. However, people using interfaces should be able to focus on one thing at a time.

          <li><strong>Limited tooltips:</strong> You consider the use of the HTML title attribute to provide information about controls. Considering titles are not exposed to keyboard users and cannot be styled, you resolve to provide clear inline labels instead.</li>
